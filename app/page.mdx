# Yanis Sebastian Zürcher

This page is quieter than my [portfolio](https://sola.ysz.life).

Here I'll be sharing my [thoughts](/thoughts), which include things such as fragments, reflections, and experiments that don't always fit into a project.

Some of them will be about design, code, and the tools I work with. Others may wander into different places — ideas, questions, or notes I don't want to lose.

It's a personal space, meant to be simple:
a place to pause, to write, and to keep track of where my mind drifts.

If you want to leave your own thoughts, you can do so [here](/guestbook).
