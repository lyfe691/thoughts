# COVID, BTC, M1

These are the 3 things in 2020 that tremendously changed the way I think about my life, the world I see and the tools I touch everyday.

**COVID-19** changed everyone’s life. I was in Wuhan, the center of the pandemic, back in January. 
And suddenly I got lost in the flood of information.

I don't want to talk about the virus in this blog post. After many sleepless nights I made it clear to myself, about what I should spend more time with in my life. Things I enjoy, people I love, and most importantly: myself.

The obsession with information and connection just doesn’t make me happier. I was overwhelmed with pressure coming from the outside and I didn't understand why. I started to delete unnecessary apps as much as I can (remember that nothing was _necessary_ before you started to use it). Last year I started to take notes of my dreams. I started to make creative artworks with code. I started to read poems.

**BTC** doubled its highest historical price very quickly. I knew BTC in 2013 and did my first crypto investment in 2016. But I never took it seriously like many other people, until 2020. Of course, I have to admit that the price was the reason which got my attention again. But this time I had a conclusion on what it actually is. (In a society) what is value and what is price? What is trust and what is common sense?

**Apple M1** is a new laptop chip shipped by Apple in 2020. It achieved significant improvements on [performance-per-watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_per_watt#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20performance%20per%20watt,every%20watt%20of%20power%20consumed.). 

As a web developer we talk about performance everyday but sadly it just feels not good enough, not even near.

But our machines are [not slow](https://esbuild.github.io). When I was doing algorithm competitions ~10 years ago, an important metric I still remember was ~10<sup>9</sup> “calculations” per second in C++, with that old CPU. If your program takes longer than 1 second, you will get a 0 point.

That’s a lot comparing to what we are doing in web today. I can create a complex shader that renders real-world 3D objects and rays at 120 fps, but it's so difficult to create a 30 fps web experience.

Although web development is so different and there’re various reasons. However we still can do better and we _should_ do better. All I want to say is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk).
