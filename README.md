# thoughts

A personal space where I share fragments, reflections, and notes.  
Built with Next.js + MDX, styled with Tailwind.  

- [`/`](./app/page.mdx) — about thoughts  
- [`/thoughts`](./app/thoughts) — posts & fragments  
- [`/guestbook`](./app/guestbook) — leave your own thoughts  

---

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
````

Runs on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with MDX enabled. Check it out [here](https://thoughts.ysz.life).
